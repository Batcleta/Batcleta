<h2> Hi there, i'm Washington Ferreira </h2>
<h4> The best Digital Marketer, Full Stack Developer, and Ui / Ux / Graphic Designer u'll ever meet</h4>

<h4>About Me</h4>

<p>I am a versatile professional with experience in fullstack web development, marketing and design. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology Management, which provided me with a solid foundation in computer systems and programming, including languages such as C, Python, and web development methodologies.</p>

<p>However, I am always looking to improve my skills and currently, I am enrolled in a learning program from Ada Coders/Santander to enhance my Java skills. I am also an autodidact, who taught myself new programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, PHP, and Java, as well as front-end frameworks like React, Next.js, React Native, and a bit of Angular and Vue.js. I also learned how to create Express and Nest APIs using TypeScript on Node.js. I achieved this by utilizing online resources such as tutorials, documentation, and forums, and taking on personal projects to challenge myself and solve complex problems.</p>

<p>
In addition to improving my programming skills, I also worked on my English language skills, which are essential in the tech industry. I read books, watched videos, and talked with native speakers to improve my understanding and fluency in the language.</p>
